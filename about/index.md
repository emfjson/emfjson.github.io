The emf-json project is actually an umbrella of projects that aim to provide support for the JSON format, and associated technologies, to the Eclipse Modeling Framework. It is an alternative to the default XML serialization format (XMI) used by default by the Eclipse Modeling Framework.

This format is simple and customizable and preserves the features of the XMI format, e.g. object fragment identifiers, inter and cross object references.

## JSON Format

Description of the JSON format for Ecore models.

## Document

A JSON document is the actual representation of a Resource. It can contain a single element as a JSON Object or a collection of elements as a JSON Array.

The document shown below represents a Resource containing a single element. The element is an object of type `EClass` and contains 2
features, respectively an `EAttribute` and a `EReference`.

```json
{
    "eClass": "http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore#//EClass",
    "name": "Foo",
    "eStructuralFeatures": [
        {
            "eClass": "http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore#//EAttribute",
            "name": "bar",
            "eType": "http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore#//EString"
        },
        {
            "eClass": "http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore#//EReference",
            "name": "foos",
            "upperBound": -1,
            "eType": "http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore#//Foo"
        }
    ]
}
```

The second document represents a Resource whose content is made of 2 objects of type `Foo`. Those are instances of the `EClass`
defined in the previous document.

When a Resource contains more than one object, it's content is serialized as a JSON array. The content of the array being
JSON objects.

```json
[
    {
        "eClass": "http://emfjson.org/sample#//Foo",
        "bar": "A"
    },
    {
        "eClass": "http://emfjson.org/sample#//Foo",
        "bar": "B"
    }
]
```

We can note that in this document the second object declares an inter-reference to the first object via it's property `eSuperTypes`.

Internal and external or cross references represent link between objects. In EMF, those links are defined by `EReferences` that
are generally not containments.

An example of external references can be found in both example documents under the objects' property `eClass`. The property declares
the type of the object, that is another object store in a document identified by a URI.

We will come back later on the format used to represent objects' references inside a same document and between objects
from different documents.

## EObject

EObjects are represented in JSON as JSON object (like this `{}`).

Each key of the JSON object represents a structural feature (`EAttribute` or `EReference`) of the EObject. The associated
value is the value of the structural feature. The value can be represented in the form of a `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `object`
or `array` depending on the type of the feature.

EMFJson format uses a special key to identify the type of an object. This special key is `eClass` and gives us the type of
the object in the form of a URI.

The following example presents the representation of an instance of EClass as JSON object.

```json
{
	"eClass": "http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore#//EPackage",
	"name": "myModel",
	"nsURI": "http://example.org/myModel",
	"eClassifiers": [
		{
    		"eClass": "http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore#//EClass",
		    "name": "Foo"
	    }
	]
}
```

```json
{
    "eClass": "http://example.org/myModel#//Foo"
}
```

## EList

EList are represented in the form of JSON arrays. Each element of the array is a JSON object.

```json
{
    "eClass": "http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore#//EClass",
    "eStructuralFeatures": [
        { ... },
        { ... }
    ]
}
```

## EAttribute

EAttributes are properties of EObjects and are mapped to JSON key values, where values are primitive types (string, number, boolean).

```json
{
    "name": "Joe",
    "age": 18,
    "male": true
}
```

## EReference

EReferences represent links between EObjects. They can be containments or references. In both cases, they can link elements
from the same document or link elements from different documents.

### Containment

Single value containment:

```json
{
    "eClass": "http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore#//Foo",
    "element": {
        "eClass": "http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore#//Bar"
    }
}
```

Multi value containment:

```json
{
    "eClass": "http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore#//Foo",
    "elements": [
        {
            "eClass": "http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore#//Bar"
        },
        {
            "eClass": "http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore#//Bar"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Inner Reference


References are represented as a JSON object containing a key ```$ref```. In the case of an inner document reference, the value of
the key is the fragment identifier of the referenced object.

Single value reference:

```json
{
    "eClass": "http://www.eclipselabs.org/emfjson/junit#//Node",
    "label": "root",
    "target": {
        "$ref": "//@child.0"
    },
    "child": [
        {
            "eClass": "http://www.eclipselabs.org/emfjson/junit#//Node",
            "label": "n1",
            "source" : {
                "$ref": "/"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Multi value references are represented by JSON object in an array:

```json
{
    "eClass": "...",
    "element": [
        {
            "$ref": "//@foo.0/@foo.1"
        },
        {
            "$ref": "//@foo.0/@foo.2"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Cross Reference

Single value reference:

```json
{
    "userId": "1",
    "name": "Paul",
    "friends": [
        {
            "$ref" : "platform:/plugin/org.eclipselabs.emfjson.junit/tests/test-proxy-2.json#2"
        }
    ],
    "uniqueFriend": {
        "$ref" : "platform:/plugin/org.eclipselabs.emfjson.junit/tests/test-proxy-2.json#3"
    }
}
```
